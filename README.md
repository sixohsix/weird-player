# Weird Canada Player

An HTML5/JavaScript audio player for [Weird
Canada](http://weirdcanada.com/).

Unlike most audio players it also has to parse Wordpress API data and
pull out song metadata from the raw HTML, so it's kinda special. This
may make it weird to use on other sites, but the parse module is easy
to replace with something for your purpose.
